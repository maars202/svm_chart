# svm_chart


As part of my co-learning project in SMU Business Intelligence Analytics, we experimented with SVM model using a kaggle students performance dataset and added the dataset to an existing plotly dashboard template and deployed it to heroku. This dataset's performance dataset can be found as "student_performance" under datasets dropdown button.
